   LSH CMS — TRAINING LIBRARY: HARDCODED MOCK CASES
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   Fictional personal-injury files every training program can open
   (Receptionist / Front Desk, Intake, Case Management, EA/PA, …).
   They live in this file, not in the database, so they are identical
   for every trainee and can't be deleted (trainers' edits are saved on top,
   /api/mock-case-edits). A trainee works on one in the role of the program
   they chose (training-library.js: who edits what): the parts their program
   handles are editable, and Save Case keeps their work as their own case for
   that file. The Front Desk (and a drill) gets it view only except its Notes
   and Tasks, saved for them only (/api/mock-case-updates).

   Some client names are on more than one file on purpose (the same
   client with a second accident, or a different person with the same
   name) so the front desk practices telling files apart by the date
   of the accident and the date of birth. Files that share a name must
   have different DOLs (.github/scripts/check-data.mjs checks it).

   All people, phone numbers (555-01xx), addresses, claim and policy
   numbers here are invented for training. SSNs are masked on purpose:
   the front desk never needs, reads out or keys a full SSN.

   `caseNumber` is the file's firm case number, in the CMS's Case ID format
   (LSH-<year opened>-<type code>-<number>; functions/_utils.js nextCaseId).
   Mock numbers use the 900000+ range, which the server's counter (saved
   cases get 000001 and up) won't reach for a long time, and follow the order the files
   were opened. It's searchable and shows in the Case ID field.

   `counsel` (files in litigation): the defense counsel on the lawsuit, { name, firm, represents, phone,
   email }. contacts.js builds the 📇 Contacts directory from these files: medical providers (facilities),
   adjusters (bi, pipum), opposing counsel (counsel), clients, and others (emergency contacts, the parties
   at fault, lien holders, health plans, police agencies, employers).

   `critical` (optional) is the ⚠ Critical note under the case header (case-alerts.js): what everyone must
   see before talking about the case (500 characters at most). `adr` (optional) fills the ADR tab: each
   mediation or arbitration's type, setBy, status, attend, neutral, provider, date, time, where, brief, prep,
   carrierRep, fee, lastDemand, lastOffer, result and notes (each select one of the tab's options). A lien
   may carry its status (one of the Liens tab's statuses), notified, requested, final and notes.

   `injury` fills the Profile tab's Primary Injury card: primary, parts, type and
   surgery (each one of the card's options), prior and details. Only what the
   file says is filled in.

   `parties` (optional) fills the Parties Involved tab, one row per person: role (one of
   the tab's roles), name, phone, contact (email or mailing address), insurance (carrier and
   claim #), vehicle (the Vehicle / Location line), statement, represented, dob, sex, dl,
   ems, street, city, state, zip, vehicleYmm, color, plate, owner, damage, injuries and
   notes. On a multi-vehicle file this is the police report's Unit 1 / Unit 2 / Unit 3 block,
   so the ⚖ conflict check (case-alerts.js) reads the real roles off the tab. A case saved
   before the file had parties gets them when it opens, and keeps its own rows if it has any.

   `practice` (optional) is the brief the class works from, shown by ⚖ Practice brief on the
   case banner (trainers and trainees alike): { brief, conflicts: [{ entity, role, why,
   expect }], steps: [{ icon, title, why, points: [...], check }] }. It is keyed to the facts
   above, so a changed fact has to be changed in both places.

   Each case carries a `reception` block: how to verify the caller and
   the calls the front desk is likely to get on that file, with the
   model handling. Other programs use the same cases for their own
   drills; `programs` says which libraries list the case.

   Course drills (e.g. the CM course's Front Desk Lookup) are keyed to
   the facts below. If you change a fact, update those drills too.

   FRONT DESK DRILL: incoming calls (front-desk-drill.js)
   For each call the trainee must (1) find the caller's case in the
   CMS, (2) authenticate the caller by asking for identifiers and
   comparing them to the file, (3) choose how to handle it.
   `gives` is what the caller answers when asked (null = "I don't
   know / I'd rather not say"). `gives.dol` is the caller's answer for
   the date of the accident; without it they give the file's DOL.
   When two or more files share the client's name, the trainee must
   also ask for the DOL to earn the identifier points.
   `mock: null` = not in the system. `voice` ('f' or 'm') picks a
   female or male voice for the caller on a live call.

   HARD-TO-SAY NAMES (the Recep2 callers and clients)
   How each name sounds on the phone, for the NATO spelling practice:
   - say: how it's pronounced (the stressed part in capitals). The live caller
     says it this way, and the trainer's scripts tell the role-player to.
   - heard: how a receptionist might write down what they hear. The text drill
     shows the caller's words this way, so the name has to be spelled to be found.
   A call that names one of these (front-desk-drill.js) also expects the receptionist
   to ask for the spelling and read it back with the NATO phonetic alphabet.
